## Project Overview
GUTSS is a research project that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to identify and segment shark organs in digital images. The project aims to streamline the process of studying shark anatomy and biology by automating the identification and segmentation of key organs, such as the liver, heart, and gills, in shark images.
